    "text": "2.1 PRU\nThe definition of a country in this section is mostly based on the ISO denomination and defined by the airports included in it. It should not be confused with other entities like FIRs, ANSPs, charging zones or traffic zones.\nThe EUROCONTROL Airport Reference Table (DWH_PL.DIM_EC_ICAO_AIRPORT, managed by the Data Coordination Group via Collibra) maps every airport to the ISO 2-letter code of the region/country it belongs to. This mapping is done at the lowest possible level (i.e. if the region has an official ISO code, this is used and not the code of the sovereign country). This allows experts across the Agency to use the grouping that suits their needs.\nThe PRU airport table ([add name]) is a view on the EUROCONTROL Airport Reference Table and uses the field ‘[field name]’ to define the countries in the table below. These are the default definitions to be used in AIU products, unless there are reasons to do otherwise.\nThe country name ([field name]) in the PRU airport table is taken from the EUROCONTROL ISO Country Reference Table ([table name] also managed by the Data Coordination Group via Collibra) and is in line with EUROCONTROL Legal Service’s recommendations.\nIn addition to the country definitions above, depending on the metric , in particular when presenting flights including overflights, the designations below are also used.",
